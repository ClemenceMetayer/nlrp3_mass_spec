### Install necessary packages

[CosinorPy](https://github.com/mmoskon/CosinorPy)

### Verify the data

For each dataset (Mass Spec or RNA Seq), in the corresponding folder, there must be the corresponding 'cosinor_data_concat_serie.csv',
'cosinor_results_concat_serie.csv', the original file with the data (Mass_Spec_data_log10 or ) and 'results_rain.csv'.
One or more files can be missing because they are too heavy so we will need to copy and paste them.

### Have a look at the notebook `results_circadian_clock.ipynb`

This notebook presents the results of the analysis with the best period for each of the circadian clock element, NLRP3 and ATM.
